# @use-crux/local

## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 53b04a3: Refresh npm-facing package documentation and homepage metadata so package pages point users to cruxjs.dev and the core package README presents a concise onboarding path.

  Allow `@use-crux/google` consumers to use either `@google/genai` 1.x or 2.x.

  Document the single-turn provider bundle authoring path in adapter package READMEs.

- b7b8c2c: Rename the bundled native worker binary from `crux-indexer-worker` to `crux-static-index-worker` to reflect its Static Syntax / Static Index ownership. The `crux` CLI is unchanged and discovers the renamed sibling binary automatically; the only visible change is the binary filename shipped inside the `@use-crux/local-<os>-<cpu>` platform packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 96fb6b7: Prepare the first npm release under the `@use-crux` package scope.

  Document the native AST beta parity gate, release checklist, and `experimental.indexer.nativeAst`
  troubleshooting guidance.

  Fix `make local` so the current-platform Rust/Oxc worker binary is replaced atomically when an old
  worker process is still running.
