## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 01ce116: Add atomic `RecordStore.create()` support and use it for task creation so concurrent duplicate task IDs fail with `DuplicateTaskIdError`. Record adapters now need to implement the conditional insert primitive; Convex component refs include a matching `insert` mutation.
- 78592f0: Harden Memory namespace handling and capture scheduling: dynamic proposal operations now resolve from input, synchronous tool collection throws clear errors for async namespaces or async block tools, and `memory({ capture: { mode } })` is available with `processing` kept as a deprecated alias.

  Align Memory store adapters with the beta `RecordStore` contract: `@use-crux/core` now exposes a reusable store conformance helper for adapter tests, deprecated private `memory/types` store aliases point to `RecordStore`, and the Upstash adapter supports page-shaped Convex component lists with decoded filtering and hydrated vector search metadata.

  Add the canonical Storage Beta type surface at `@use-crux/core/storage`, including `RecordStore`, `RecordEntry`, `RecordPage`, `RecordWriteOptions`, exact scalar filters, discriminated vector queries, `{ records, vectors, blobs }` bundles, and typed `StorageError` codes.

  Harden the in-memory Storage Beta adapters: record stores now validate JSON and TTL inputs, apply lazy TTL and exact null-aware filters, vector stores validate dense/sparse queries and pre-filter metadata correctly, blob stores expose `head`/delete lifecycle behavior, and `@use-crux/core/storage/testing/vitest` provides reusable record/vector/blob conformance suites.

  Move core workspace, indexing, retrieval, indexed knowledge, embedding cache, and semantic cache consumers onto Storage Beta `records`/`vectors`/`blobs` configuration, with vector-backed search requiring pre-filter-capable vector stores.

  Expose Convex and Upstash Storage Beta adapters: Convex now provides `convexRecordStore`, dense-only `convexVectorStore`, `convexStorage`, and a full-lifecycle workspace blob store; Upstash now provides a SCAN-backed Redis `RecordStore` and a stricter Vector `VectorStore` that validates filters, wraps backend errors, and reports conservative capabilities by default.

  Harden Memory capture and proposal review: adapter-bound memory capture now preserves settled tool results and errors when available, proposal approve/reject/edit operations are pending-only to prevent duplicate writes, and proposal write observations include flattened source metadata.

  Make Memory rendering predictable under token pressure: `budget.maxTokens` is now enforced for memory contexts and individual blocks, and extractive memory blocks support explicit list/recent and semantic render strategies.

  Expose Memory beta behavior in observability and Project Index surfaces: budgeted memory rendering now emits inspectable `memory.read` observations, static memory extraction records capture mode, budgets, render strategies, and retention metadata, and devtools memory details can show indexed episodic retention policy.

  Expose Storage Beta in Project Index facts: static extraction now records record/vector/blob store definitions, storage bundles, scoped storage, storage dependencies on retrievers/workspaces, and matching Rust/Oxc native parity.

  Resolve Storage Beta Project Index facts semantically: TypeScript and native semantic backends now agree on storage aliases, imported stores, config object indirection, bundle composition, scoped storage, and retriever/workspace storage relations.

  Surface Storage Beta in Crux Local and devtools: local Project Index payloads now include privacy-safe storage summaries, component usage, warnings, lint findings, cache replay support, and devtools storage inventory/detail panels.

  Refresh Storage Beta docs and public JSDoc so `RecordStore`, `VectorStore`, `BlobStore`, `{ records, vectors, blobs }` bundles, adapter capability claims, and devtools storage inspection are documented as the primary public storage path.

  Refresh Memory beta docs and public JSDoc so capture modes, render strategies, budgets, strict proposal review, retention metadata, and the `RecordStore` adapter contract are documented from the exported API surface through the user guides.

  Polish Memory beta inspection surfaces: local devtools memory details now expose capture mode, memory and block budgets, block render strategies, write/proposal mode, and retention metadata from the Project Index; run detail memory spans surface render-budget decisions and proposal status; docs include concrete memory observability record examples.

  Keep native indexing in parity for Memory beta metadata: Rust/Oxc static extraction now carries the same capture mode, budget, render strategy, disabled-render, write mode, and retention fields as the TypeScript extractor, with semantic backend parity fixtures covering the beta syntax.

- 4b29d0c: Add the `@use-crux/core/runtime` subpath with Runtime Engine port contracts, typed runtime diagnostics, wake envelope validation, retry helpers, the pure work state-machine surface, kernel composite operations, outbox dispatch, the in-memory runtime store, and the `@use-crux/core/runtime/testing` conformance suites for adapter authors.

  Add the first Runtime Engine composer surface: `node()` for in-process local/test execution, `createRuntime()` for resolving composers with targets, store-backed timers and maintenance, cancellation, scoped-idle counters, and the standard `RUNTIME_REQUIRED` diagnostic factory.

  Wire existing flow handles into the Runtime Engine: runtime-backed `flow.suspend()` snapshots, reserved signal events with automatic resume from `FlowHandle.signal()`, `{ resume: false }` plus runtime-backed `FlowHandle.resume(flowId)`, replay fingerprint drift blocking, and delivery recording for multiple waiter events that arrive before replay.

  Add the flow runtime API layer: runtime-only executable `task()` targets from `@use-crux/core/runtime`, `flow.waitFor()`, barrier-buffered `flow.defer()` and `flow.after()` durable effects, scoped `flow.untilIdle()`, and name-bound `crux.flows.signal/resume/cancel`.

  Add `@use-crux/postgres/runtime` with a durable Postgres Runtime Engine store adapter, additive setup check/apply support for the Crux-owned schema, and real-Postgres conformance coverage gated by `CRUX_TEST_DATABASE_URL`.

  Add the HTTP wake layer for serverless Runtime Engine deployments: `createRuntimeHandler({ targets })`, `serverless({ store, wake })`, `genericQueue()`, and `@use-crux/upstash/runtime` `qstash()` wake delivery with QStash signature verification.

  Add host-bound Runtime Engine declarations and Convex runtime entry helpers: `RuntimeEngineDefinition` now distinguishes in-process and host-bound runtimes, `bindHostRuntime()` composes host bindings through the shared kernel path, `RUNTIME_HOST_ONLY` reports runtime use outside a required host, and `@use-crux/convex/runtime` exposes `convex()` plus `createConvexRuntimeHandlers()`.

  Add Runtime Engine artifact generation: the indexer can discover runtime flow/task targets, emit deterministic `.crux/generated/runtime/manifest.json` plus readable Next and Convex entry files, expose drift preflight helpers, and `withCrux()` can regenerate artifacts during Next builds.

  Add Runtime Engine operator tooling: `crux runtime setup`, `status`, `inspect`, `retry`, and `cancel` now route through the local worker, use typed runtime diagnostics, support JSON output, and preflight generated artifacts against durable runtime state.

  Harden Runtime Engine delivery and adapter parity: scheduled wake rows now honor `notBefore`/retry delays end-to-end, runtime-backed flows preserve object-bound replay semantics for errors, cancellation, resume options, and repeated suspend labels, Convex handler/component boundaries validate and encode runtime payloads consistently, and cross-adapter conformance now covers retry source-status guards, waiter matching, and idle-counter invariants.

  Tighten runtime artifact and handler DX: generated entry files are host-specific and marker-protected, target exports are validated before manifest generation, `withCrux()` runs during Next config evaluation for Webpack and Turbopack, unresolved name-only handler targets now fail with `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`, and malformed wake envelopes return terminal client responses instead of queue poison loops.

  Add Project Index runtime lint rules for durable target identity, exported targets, runtime API use without configured runtime support, closure-based defers, nondeterministic flow bodies, and non-serializable deferred payloads, with docs metadata and native lint parity.

  Expose bounded Runtime Engine inspection reads for work, timers, and outbox state so local tooling can show runtime status details without mutating durable state.

  Move the Postgres adapter's `pg` client to a caller-controlled peer dependency while retaining it as a repo dev dependency for tests, and refresh the package homepage to a live source URL.

  Add the Runtime Engine documentation set: core runtime reference, runtime deployment guides, recipe-only adapter mappings, package references for Postgres/QStash/Convex runtime surfaces, runtime lint navigation, and per-code Runtime Engine error pages.

  Fix final Runtime Engine hardening gaps: wake delivery now rechecks leased work before execution, null waiter payloads replay correctly, manual resume/retry keys are unique per invocation, runtime status counts use adapter-owned counting instead of silently truncated list samples, Postgres setup checks validate required columns, Convex component status queries avoid unindexed full-table scans, runtime artifact host detection no longer guesses from raw config text, and `runtime.missing_runtime_config` now runs in production Project Index lint paths without claiming native parity.

  Close follow-up Runtime Engine review gaps: Project Index snapshots now cache runtime-config presence for linting, destructured flow-scope runtime APIs retain TypeScript/Rust parity, manual resume/retry keys include an isolate nonce, delayed wake rows dedupe duplicate `notBefore` reschedules, Convex status counts stay under a bounded read budget, Convex outbox confirmation retains rows like other adapters, and Postgres setup column checks are covered by DDL parity tests.

  Finish the review-tail hardening: outbox duplicate suppression no longer hides legitimate re-enqueues while a row is being dispatched, maintenance re-enqueues orphaned pending work, config-load failures no longer produce false missing-runtime lint findings, status count truncation is surfaced in CLI and devtools, and runtime artifact preflight now uses the worker-owned stale-target result instead of duplicating status rules in the CLI.

  Complete native Project Index parity for runtime task targets and missing-runtime linting so the Rust/Oxc production path matches the TypeScript baseline.

  Fix npm release staging so exported package subpaths, including `@use-crux/core/runtime`, are typechecked through their declared public entry files.

  Make the public Runtime Engine barrels isolate-safe for Convex and edge-style bundlers by moving custom wake HMAC signing/verification to WebCrypto, run the Convex runtime store through the shared adapter conformance suite with declared substrate-atomic exclusions, and keep caller-provided Convex event IDs from colliding with internal event cursors.

  Improve Convex runtime generation DX: `crux dev` now refreshes runtime artifacts on startup and watched source changes, generated writes are idempotent, Convex no longer emits a top-level `convex/crux.ts` shim, generated target imports run behind a Node action boundary via `@use-crux/convex/runtime/node`, and Convex-native `flow()` handles can execute as generated Runtime Engine targets.

  Fix Convex direct flow starts under `createCruxConvex().run()`: core runtime-backed flow APIs now resolve host-bound declarations through an active request-scoped host binding, and the Convex profile bridge installs that binding before user code starts runtime-backed work.
