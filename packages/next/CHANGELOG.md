### Minor Changes

- fa12d14: Make portable application entrypoints verifiable in both source and staged npm
  packages, remove package-wide Node engine restrictions where the primary graph
  is portable, and include the Next integration in TypeScript release staging.

  The `@use-crux/ai` root no longer downloads HTTPS transcription input
  implicitly. Portable callers must provide materialized audio; Node callers can
  import `transcribe` or `createAiSdkTranscribe` from the new
  `@use-crux/ai/transcription/node` subpath to retain the bounded, DNS-pinned
  download behavior. Portable data-URL transcription no longer relies on the
  Node `Buffer` global.

  Unify observability and host-lifecycle async scoping on Core's canonical
  carrier so no-AsyncLocalStorage runtimes retain synchronous fallback behavior
  while unsafe asynchronous ambient host scopes fail closed.

  Add portable deployment identity and privacy-safe Project Index manifest
  contracts to Core. The build-time Indexer now projects and verifies the same
  deterministic artifact internally.

  Carry immutable deployment identity through observability graph records,
  suspend/resume propagation, and local run detail. `@use-crux/otel` now exports a portable
  Resource-attribute mapper, maps lightweight identity per span, and projects
  DefinitionRefs through bounded attributes and events.

  Advance observability to schema v4 with explicit operation-family identity.
  Root runs now own an `operationId`; independently durable nested Flow, named
  defer, and Convex swarm work opens causally linked child runs while ordinary
  pipeline, parallel, consensus, delegate, generation, and host continuations
  remain spans or fresh segments. Local Runs projects one row per operation with
  aggregate child/topology health, child-before-root shells, family-atomic
  retention, and deletion tombstones. Older observability storage resets in
  place because family membership cannot be reconstructed from trace IDs. Run
  lookup and deletion now require an operation or member-run ID; W3C trace IDs
  remain correlation data and never select an operation implicitly.

  Add daemon-free `crux check` with deterministic JSON and explicit CI exit
  codes. `crux lint` now uses the same one-shot Project Index service and embedded
  worker pipeline by default while retaining its no-gate compatibility behavior
  and an explicit `--server` path.

  Add daemon-free `crux manifest` artifact generation and verified, idempotent
  `crux catalog import`. Local observability now resolves runtime definition
  references only against the exact immutable deployment manifest named by a run
  and labels current-checkout comparisons separately.
  Definition fingerprints now use normalized project-relative source identity so
  identical checkouts produce the same manifest ID; static, semantic, and Go
  snapshot cache epochs invalidate root-dependent historical fingerprints.

  Add deterministic `crux catalog` list, show, status, and explain projections
  with compiler provenance, safe source paths, Health/Eval/runtime joins, and
  truthful partial or unknown state. The beta `crux index` list/show paths now
  delegate to Catalog while category keywords and explicit reindex remain.
  Durable definition evidence now retains canonical extractor and resolved
  extension provenance, and Catalog explanations name every actual contributor
  without changing the public evidence shape or phase producer identity.
  Durable relation, source-reference, and diagnostic evidence now retains the
  same exact extractor contributors across worker, cache, and restart boundaries.

  Add opinionated `withCrux` lifecycle boundaries for Cloudflare Workers and
  Next.js while retaining their low-level adapters. Workers and Next now compose
  deferred work with contained, bounded post-response observability drains;
  `createCruxConvex().run()` owns the corresponding bounded terminal drain and
  preserves deployment identity across durable continuation boundaries.
  Rejected promises returned by advisory drain reporters are contained without
  delaying or replacing handler results or host-owned drain work.
  Rename the Next Runtime artifact build plugin to `withCruxBuild`, reserving
  `withCrux` for framework lifecycle boundaries without a compatibility alias.
  Add explicit `config({ host })` retention bindings for Node, Next.js,
  Cloudflare Workers, and Vercel. Config-only ambient defer uses an ephemeral
  invocation per call; failed or cancelled scopes now record and skip inline
  callbacks instead of running them.
  Remove defer completion classes and lifetime factories in favor of the scope
  kernel's host bindings. Serverless and Node wrappers now enqueue retained work
  through the root gate. Move the Workers `withCrux` lifecycle boundary from
  Core's deleted `/observability/workers` subpath to `@use-crux/cloudflare`,
  where its structured drain runs before the kernel flush.
  Open lazy execution scopes at Crux agent, adapter, tool, Safety, flow-step, and
  Convex bridge boundaries. Inline `defer()` now works with zero host setup inside
  defer-capable primitives on long-lived processes; nested work drains at its
  nearest boundary and streaming adapters restore one scope across Core-owned
  iteration and completion segments.
  Configured host retention now applies uniformly when any Crux primitive is the
  execution root. Primitive drains still start immediately, while retention-port
  failures propagate after deterministic sealing instead of silently accepting
  work the host cannot keep alive.
  Run Evals and their cells as execution scopes. Deferred work registered by an
  Eval task is captured as cell evidence instead of invoking inline callbacks or
  staging named Runtime work, and expired remote cells drop late observability
  writes through the shared scope-sealing policy.
  Teach setup diagnostics, the built-in defer lint, and public documentation the
  same primitive-first host-retention ladder, including exact Next, Vercel, and
  Workers remediations and the generic serverless adapter contract.
  Remove the config-dependent `defer.missing_scope` bundled lint; `crux setup`
  now owns host-retention diagnostics using selected config and platform evidence.
  Portable MCP entrypoints now fail closed when stdio is selected, while Node
  runtimes resolve their lazy stdio adapters through private conditional imports.

  Align public documentation around Catalog, Runs, Evals, and Health. Narrow
  the published Indexer root to Crux-owned compiler contracts; third-party
  authoring stays on the experimental `/extensions` subpath and is declarative,
  limited to extractors plus relation declarations.

  Correlate successful managed operation results with the exact Core-owned W3C
  trace and producing span. Generation hooks and middleware receive finalized
  results; stream handles expose identity immediately and repeat it on
  completion; completed media, agent/composition, flow, scoring, compaction,
  citation, and content-indexing summary envelopes follow the same exact-owner
  contract while provider payloads and raw values remain ID-free.
  Completed-operation bindings now use the documented exact media-operation
  vocabulary; formerly normalized spellings such as `generate-image` or
  `generateimage` no longer imply a Core-owned media span.

  Managed AI Eval tasks retain correlated response metadata after removing raw
  provider values. Eval cells continue to store logical task `runIds`, while
  assertion outcomes store exact related span IDs; neither is relabelled as a W3C
  trace ID. Semantic-cache and flow persistence boundaries prevent
  invocation-local IDs from leaking across replay or durable execution. The
  private deployed-Eval result wire advances to schema version 2 so retained task
  responses require the same correlation contract across hosts.

  Postgres Runtime snapshot decoding now revives nested suspend deadlines, and
  terminal retention recognizes expired flow snapshots.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0c3ba08: Add request-scoped `defer(callback)` with bounded host-lifetime execution, the
  explicit `@use-crux/core/defer/node` HTTP integration, and Runtime-backed named
  target staging through `await defer(target, input)`. Postgres and Convex Runtime
  stores now persist named deferred intents and recover their release through the
  existing transactional outbox. Public `defer()` is rejected during replayable
  flow execution, and the Runtime snapshot field for replay-visible child work is
  hard-renamed from `scheduledEffects` to `scheduledWork` with no compatibility
  field or read path.
  Inline callbacks now isolate nested named commits per callback and report late
  commit failures without stopping sibling cleanup.
  Project Index now discovers public inline and named scheduling sites as stable
  `deferred-work` definitions, resolves their task and enclosing-definition
  relations, and reports replay-unsafe, floating-promise, missing-scope, and
  explicitly missing-Runtime diagnostics.
  Public deferred work emits `defer.scheduled` and `defer.run` observability
  spans with causal `triggered` edges, one lightweight grouped run when no
  originating Crux run exists, and quiet diagnostics-only internal composition.
  Inline retained tasks flush only after their full graph closes. Named wakes use
  fresh same-trace runs and segments with a causal edge, then flush only after the
  durable outcome commits.
  Devtools Catalog and Runs surface deferred-work kinds, lifecycle states, and
  honest handler-returned streaming notes.
  Provider-neutral serverless hosts live at `@use-crux/core/defer/serverless`
  (injected `waitUntil` / `after` / named-only). `@use-crux/next` binds Next.js
  `after()` as response-finished. Convex bridge runs install a named-only lifetime
  so inline callbacks fail with `DEFER_CAPABILITY_MISSING` while named Runtime work
  remains supported.
  Docs cover host reliability boundaries, completion classes, strict named commit,
  at-least-once edges, cancellation limits, and the distinction from
  `flow.defer()` / future Effects.

  The defer setup contributor now participates in `crux setup`, reporting host
  integration and named Runtime durability readiness without redefining the
  shared `@use-crux/core/setup` contract.
  Deferred intent stores now preserve the first terminal state across memory,
  Postgres, and Convex, and setup distinguishes inline host wrapping from literal
  named-work `durableFinalization: true` capability.
