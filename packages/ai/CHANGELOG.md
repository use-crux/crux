## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dcee4fa: Introduce the Retrieval & RAG stable beta public API spine at `@use-crux/core/retrieval`, including `knowledgeBase`, named `retrievalRecipe`, typed retrieval steps, canonical `RetrieveRequest`, schema-derived metadata filters, recipe traces, and grounding/tool integration types.

  Wire `knowledgeBase` lifecycle methods to the existing indexing, corpus, indexed-knowledge, storage, and retriever primitives. Knowledge bases can now index, reindex, remove sources, create namespace-scoped handles, retrieve through store-backed indexes, and inspect lifecycle/storage capability metadata.

  Implement the named single-retriever `retrievalRecipe` runtime. Recipes now execute typed steps, expose `.retrieveWithTrace()` and `.asRetriever()`, capture failed-step traces, run fanout with bounded concurrency, keep score history in structured hit provenance, support recipe-level and per-step models, emit recipe/step observability spans, and replace the old internal pipeline/stage modules.

  Add federated `retrievalRecipe` sources. The built-in retrieve step now accepts multiple retrievers or weighted source entries, runs source/query retrieval concurrently, fuses cross-source hits with structured per-source provenance, supports `fail` and `skip-with-warning` source failure policies, and records per-source retrieve attribution in recipe traces.

  Add session-backed grounding and typed retrieval tool payloads. Grounded citation validation now accounts for both injected and tool-discovered hits without parsing tool strings or closing over mutable hit arrays, retrieval tools return lean structured `crux.retrieval.hits` payloads with model-facing renderers, and `getSource` can read discovered session hits or active store-backed indexed chunks with explicit visibility.

  Add Retrieval/RAG storage conformance coverage and Convex profile mirroring. Core now exposes a vector-store conformance suite that verifies namespace filtering, delete and sparse/hybrid capability claims, and indexed-knowledge hydration diagnostics; hydration misses now fail with `RetrievalRunError("hydration_miss")` instead of silently returning empty results. `@use-crux/convex/retrieval` mirrors the core retrieval API with Convex runtime storage defaults for `knowledgeBase()` and store-backed `retriever()`.

  Add provider-agnostic RAG evaluation metrics to the Quality system. `scorers.rag.*` now includes deterministic recall@k, MRR, expected source coverage, context precision, citation validity, and trace-shape snapshot scorers, and `evaluate()` can run retrieval recipes directly or through `target.recipe()`. New retriever spans emit the beta `retrieval.retrieve` observability primitive.

  Document the stable beta Retrieval/RAG surface around knowledge bases, retrievers, recipes, grounding sessions, typed retrieval tools, and Quality-based RAG evaluation. `knowledgeBase().grounding()`, `knowledgeBase().recipe()`, and `retrievalRecipe().asGrounding()` now delegate to the functional retriever/recipe/grounding runtime paths.

  Add the shared reranking contract and adapter bindings for the beta recipe surface. Core now exports `Reranker` and `judgeReranker()`, `rerank()` accepts custom engines, `@use-crux/ai` binds native AI SDK reranking, and the Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google adapters expose matching `retrievalModel()` and judge-backed `reranker()` factories on their adapter instances. Devtools and Project Index now understand beta retrieval recipe/step primitives while keeping historical pipeline/stage compatibility.

  Promote `reranker()` to an index-visible RAG primitive. Static, semantic, native, and local Project Index paths now emit `rag.reranker` definitions, `rag.recipe.step.uses_reranker` relations from `rerank({ engine })` recipe steps, and a cache epoch migration for the updated static output. The experimental indexer authoring API also exposes ordered object-or-helper config readers so mixed recipe step arrays keep authored order. Devtools renders rerankers as first-class catalog nodes, shows authored recipe steps and step dependencies in the recipe hero, and the built-in `rag.recipe_step_unresolved_target` lint surfaces recipe step dependencies that cannot be resolved to indexed retrievers, scorers, or rerankers.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 890d660: Deepen the loop-owned execution boundary into a single gateway-closed `LoopRuntimePort`, replacing the per-call `client` threading of the old `ExecutorSpec`/`SdkLoopDialect` seam.

  `@use-crux/core`:
  - Replace `ExecutorSpec` with `LoopRuntimePort` (`id`, `describeModel`, `mapSettings`, `runTextLoop`, `runStructuredAttempt`, `runStream`, `replayStream`). The port is already bound to its SDK client, so each run method takes only an `ExecutorRequest` — there is no per-call `client` argument.
  - `bind()` now returns the client-dependent `BoundLoopRuntime` (renamed from `BoundLoopOwnedRuntime`), which core assembles with `id`/`describeModel`/`mapSettings` into the port.
  - Rename `executorAdapter(spec)(client)` to `loopRuntimeAdapter(port)`.
  - Testing: `fakeExecutor` → `fakeLoopRuntime` (returns `{ runtime, calls }`); `executorSpecConformance` → `loopRuntimePortConformance` (harness `prepare()` returns `{ runtime, model }`).

  `@use-crux/ai`:
  - Add `createAiSdkLoopRuntime(gateway): LoopRuntimePort<LanguageModel>` and the `AiSdkLoopRuntime` type — the adapter from `SdkGateway` to the core port. `aiSdkProviderRuntime` and `createCruxAi({ gateway })` are unchanged.

  `defineProviderRuntime({ ownership: 'loop-owned', loop })` authoring is unchanged except that `loop.bind()` now returns `runTextLoop`/`runStructuredAttempt`/`runStream` (was `run`/`attemptStructured`/`stream`).

### Patch Changes

- 53b04a3: Refresh npm-facing package documentation and homepage metadata so package pages point users to cruxjs.dev and the core package README presents a concise onboarding path.

  Allow `@use-crux/google` consumers to use either `@google/genai` 1.x or 2.x.

  Document the single-turn provider bundle authoring path in adapter package READMEs.

- 5477724: Add the public observability event spine APIs: `subscribeObservability()` for in-process graph-record subscribers and `CRUX_OBSERVABILITY_CHANNEL` / `CruxObservabilityChannelMessage` for Node diagnostics-channel consumers.

  Remove the legacy runtime instrumentation hook bus. `withTelemetry()` now subscribes to the canonical graph-record stream by default, and `createOtelRecordSubscriber()` remains available for custom OTel wiring.

  Migrate AI agent, Convex swarm/compaction, and ingest parser instrumentation to canonical graph records so they continue emitting observability after the hook bus removal. `TelemetryOptions.recordContent` is removed; use the core `observability.recordInputs` / `recordOutputs` policy instead.

  Add observability capture policy controls: `config({ observability: { recordInputs, recordOutputs } })`. Disabled input/output artifacts are emitted as reference records with size/hash metadata and no preview.

  Generation and streaming span-end records now carry `gen.*` performance metrics, and `@use-crux/otel` maps them to exported `gen_ai.client.*` attribute constants.

  Restore the documented default `withTelemetry()` behavior: when no lightweight exporter is configured, `@use-crux/otel` now uses the globally registered OpenTelemetry tracer instead of silently dropping spans.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 96fb6b7: Prepare the first npm release under the `@use-crux` package scope.

  Document the native AST beta parity gate, release checklist, and `experimental.indexer.nativeAst`
  troubleshooting guidance.

  Fix `make local` so the current-platform Rust/Oxc worker binary is replaced atomically when an old
  worker process is still running.
