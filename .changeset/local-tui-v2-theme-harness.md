Migrate the local TUI to the Bubble Tea/Lip Gloss/Bubbles v2 stack, centralize terminal colors in the shared theme palette, add deterministic TUI golden/resize test harness coverage, and introduce the rect-based TUI kit layout, virtualized list/table, memo, and component primitives used by the rebuilt shell and legacy screen adapters.

Add the coalescing in-process TUI reactivity bridge with revision-tagged domain routing, hidden-screen stale marking, quality insight/cassette drift event coverage, and fixes for v2 text input and CLI color gating regressions.
