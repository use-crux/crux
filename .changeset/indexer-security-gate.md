Harden indexer untrusted-input handling: source-only static syntax planning no longer imports project config, extension loading verifies resolved package identity and containment before import, and source-map disk reads are contained to the project root.

Preserve semantic source-profile completeness across worker streams so incomplete profiles are not reused through the semantic facts cache, and split Project Index worker transport limits so multi-line fact/artifact streams can exceed the per-line cap without failing.

Harden Project Index correctness and determinism across patch merging, native/static syntax parity, record-lane extraction, stale provided-record handling, extension diagnostics, and rejected cache reads so cached, incremental, and native-backed runs preserve the same read-model facts.

Improve Project Index watch latency and live updates with lower save-path debounce windows, exported-interface source hashes that stop body-only edits from cascading to dependents, per-file WebSocket index deltas, cancellable background semantic waves, and watch-run fallback/status telemetry in local devtools. Source rows now include source and interface hash evidence so incremental planning can safely preserve single-file leaf edits across restarts.

Freeze the indexer stable-beta public surface: `ExtractContext` and extension manifest authoring types now have type-level guards, root syntax-record projection options no longer expose host-only worker controls, host static-index helpers carry those controls through explicit `ForHost` APIs, runtime `use` target matching is data-driven, and docs now mark root/testing/source-resolver/contracts as stable-beta surfaces while keeping extensions experimental and host subpaths Crux-owned.
