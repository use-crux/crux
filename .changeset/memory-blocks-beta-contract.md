Harden Memory namespace handling and capture scheduling: dynamic proposal operations now resolve from input, synchronous tool collection throws clear errors for async namespaces or async block tools, and `memory({ capture: { mode } })` is available with `processing` kept as a deprecated alias.

Align Memory store adapters with the beta `RecordStore` contract: `@use-crux/core` now exposes a reusable store conformance helper for adapter tests, deprecated private `memory/types` store aliases point to `RecordStore`, and the Upstash adapter supports page-shaped Convex component lists with decoded filtering and hydrated vector search metadata.

Add the canonical Storage Beta type surface at `@use-crux/core/storage`, including `RecordStore`, `RecordEntry`, `RecordPage`, `RecordWriteOptions`, exact scalar filters, discriminated vector queries, `{ records, vectors, blobs }` bundles, and typed `StorageError` codes.

Harden the in-memory Storage Beta adapters: record stores now validate JSON and TTL inputs, apply lazy TTL and exact null-aware filters, vector stores validate dense/sparse queries and pre-filter metadata correctly, blob stores expose `head`/delete lifecycle behavior, and `@use-crux/core/storage/testing/vitest` provides reusable record/vector/blob conformance suites.

Move core workspace, indexing, retrieval, indexed knowledge, embedding cache, and semantic cache consumers onto Storage Beta `records`/`vectors`/`blobs` configuration, with vector-backed search requiring pre-filter-capable vector stores.

Expose Convex and Upstash Storage Beta adapters: Convex now provides `convexRecordStore`, dense-only `convexVectorStore`, `convexStorage`, and a full-lifecycle workspace blob store; Upstash now provides a SCAN-backed Redis `RecordStore` and a stricter Vector `VectorStore` that validates filters, wraps backend errors, and reports conservative capabilities by default.

Harden Memory capture and proposal review: adapter-bound memory capture now preserves settled tool results and errors when available, proposal approve/reject/edit operations are pending-only to prevent duplicate writes, and proposal write observations include flattened source metadata.

Make Memory rendering predictable under token pressure: `budget.maxTokens` is now enforced for memory contexts and individual blocks, and extractive memory blocks support explicit list/recent and semantic render strategies.

Expose Memory beta behavior in observability and Project Index surfaces: budgeted memory rendering now emits inspectable `memory.read` observations, static memory extraction records capture mode, budgets, render strategies, and retention metadata, and devtools memory details can show indexed episodic retention policy.

Expose Storage Beta in Project Index facts: static extraction now records record/vector/blob store definitions, storage bundles, scoped storage, storage dependencies on retrievers/workspaces, and matching Rust/Oxc native parity.

Resolve Storage Beta Project Index facts semantically: TypeScript and native semantic backends now agree on storage aliases, imported stores, config object indirection, bundle composition, scoped storage, and retriever/workspace storage relations.

Surface Storage Beta in Crux Local and devtools: local Project Index payloads now include privacy-safe storage summaries, component usage, warnings, lint findings, cache replay support, and devtools storage inventory/detail panels.

Refresh Storage Beta docs and public JSDoc so `RecordStore`, `VectorStore`, `BlobStore`, `{ records, vectors, blobs }` bundles, adapter capability claims, and devtools storage inspection are documented as the primary public storage path.

Refresh Memory beta docs and public JSDoc so capture modes, render strategies, budgets, strict proposal review, retention metadata, and the `RecordStore` adapter contract are documented from the exported API surface through the user guides.

Polish Memory beta inspection surfaces: local devtools memory details now expose capture mode, memory and block budgets, block render strategies, write/proposal mode, and retention metadata from the Project Index; run detail memory spans surface render-budget decisions and proposal status; docs include concrete memory observability record examples.

Keep native indexing in parity for Memory beta metadata: Rust/Oxc static extraction now carries the same capture mode, budget, render strategy, disabled-render, write mode, and retention fields as the TypeScript extractor, with semantic backend parity fixtures covering the beta syntax.
