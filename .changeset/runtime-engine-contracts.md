'@use-crux/core': minor
---

Add the `@use-crux/core/runtime` subpath with Runtime Engine port contracts, typed runtime diagnostics, wake envelope validation, retry helpers, the pure work state-machine surface, kernel composite operations, outbox dispatch, the in-memory runtime store, and the `@use-crux/core/runtime/testing` conformance suites for adapter authors.

Add the first Runtime Engine composer surface: `node()` for in-process local/test execution, `createRuntime()` for resolving composers with targets, store-backed timers and maintenance, cancellation, scoped-idle counters, and the standard `RUNTIME_REQUIRED` diagnostic factory.

Wire existing flow handles into the Runtime Engine: runtime-backed `flow.suspend()` snapshots, reserved signal events with automatic resume from `FlowHandle.signal()`, `{ resume: false }` plus runtime-backed `FlowHandle.resume(flowId)`, replay fingerprint drift blocking, and delivery recording for multiple waiter events that arrive before replay.

Add the flow runtime API layer: runtime-only executable `task()` targets from `@use-crux/core/runtime`, `flow.waitFor()`, barrier-buffered `flow.defer()` and `flow.after()` durable effects, scoped `flow.untilIdle()`, and name-bound `crux.flows.signal/resume/cancel`.
