Promote `@use-crux/core/observability`, `@use-crux/otel`, and the local Go observability read model to stable beta, replacing process-local reliability assumptions with an explicit multi-invocation contract. See ADR 0002 for the full rationale.

Cut the graph record wire/storage contract over to schema v2 only (`runId` for the logical operation, `traceId` for distributed correlation, and `segmentId`/`segmentSeq` for one physical process/isolate/invocation). There is no v1 compatibility window: on first startup against the new schema, the local Go backend transactionally discards pre-v2 observability rows, which carry no truthful execution-segment identity, and rebuilds automatically. Every other local table is untouched and no manual `.crux` deletion is required.

Add explicit lifecycle ownership for suspend/resume: `run.suspend({ reason })` ends the current segment and returns a serializable `CruxPropagationCarrier`, and `observe.resumeRun(carrier, { reason })` opens a fresh segment on the same logical run and emits `run:resume` before any child record. `observe.withContext()` remains context-only and can no longer be mistaken for a resume/suspend/end mechanism. Flow suspension and Convex swarm turns now use this shape instead of persisting a captured context and calling an implicit end.

Make delivery lossless and per-record. The transport now inspects an indexed disposition (`accepted`/`rejected`, with a `retryable` flag) for every sent record instead of trusting `response.ok`; a malformed or partial receipt retries every unaccounted-for record. `recordId` identifies immutable content: an exact duplicate is accepted idempotently, and a conflicting payload under the same id is rejected and diagnosed rather than silently overwriting the original.

Add a framework-neutral host lifecycle port (context/defer/deadline) with first-party bindings: Node (`withNodeObservableInvocation`), generic serverless (`withObservableInvocation`), Cloudflare Workers (`withWorkersObservableInvocation` from the new `@use-crux/core/observability/workers` subpath, using `ExecutionContext.waitUntil` with no `nodejs_compat` requirement), and Convex (`createCruxConvex()`/`action`/`internalAction`/agent/swarm wrappers, bound automatically). Every wrapper reports a structured `ObservabilityFlushResult` (`status`, `delivered`, `rejected`, `remaining`, `deadlineExceeded`) instead of a boolean; pass `onDrain` to inspect it. The Convex default flush bound drops from 20 seconds to a fixed 3-second window, since Convex exposes no per-invocation deadline API — existing callers relying on the old window should inspect `onDrain` or pass an explicit timeout.

Remove the stream-finalizer grace timer. Only a stream's own terminal signal (drain, early return, or throw) ends its span, immediately, with stream-derived metrics; a late or never-arriving provider completion attaches as a linked `usage.observed` event/artifact and can never reopen the span or change its recorded duration/status.

Build a real active OTel execution bridge in `@use-crux/otel`: `withTelemetry()` now activates the SDK span around the actual instrumented callback (`trace.getActiveSpan()` resolves correctly inside real work, nested spans parent correctly), maps `run:suspend`/`run:resume` correctly instead of crashing the subscriber on those record types, and starts a fresh root span sharing the original `traceId` on resume rather than reopening a stale one. Add W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate` inject/extract helpers and an explicit `baggageAttributeAllowlist` (nothing copied by default). `observe.flush()`/`observe.shutdown()` now also force-flush the installed telemetry manager's exporter/processor work, bounded by the host lifecycle port above.

Add one revisioned Go Runs read model (`/api/observability/runs/page`, `/api/observability/runs/delta`) that joins observability and Quality server-side through an explicit correlation field, bumping a monotonic revision per affected run inside the same ingest transaction it publishes after commit. Fix a duplicate-`recordId` conflict path that previously let a second, different payload overwrite immutable raw content, and fix a Quality/observability correlation bug that could key an unrelated run's feedback/score data onto the wrong run's `traceId`/`runId` collision.

Move DevTools Runs and run detail onto that one read model: delete the client-side merge of a Quality-terminal row list and a separately-fetched observability-running row list, add truthful `suspended`/`incomplete`/`conflicted` status and `unknown`/`healthy`/`degraded` delivery-health rendering, and gate WebSocket invalidation on the published revision so a reconnect performs a bounded catch-up instead of an unconditional refetch or stale cache.
