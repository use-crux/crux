Adopt parsed Zod input throughout prompt resolution, run `sanitize` before top-level auto-escape, warn when nested string input cannot be auto-escaped, and collect nested `when()`/`match()`/contributor schemas consistently for prompt input validation.

Split context resolver memoization from provider cache hints: dynamic contexts now use `memo: { ttl }` for app-side memoization and `cache: true` only for provider cache breakpoints. Prompt definitions now reject duplicate statically reachable entry ids, context memoization requires a dynamic `id`-bearing context, and dynamic context callbacks receive only their declared input fields.

Provider system adaptations now participate in the typed system block model. In prompt mode, `prependSystem`/`appendSystem` produce `systemBlocks` with `source: "adaptation:<key>"`; prepend adaptations land after the stable cached prefix so provider cache boundaries stay byte-stable. Messages-mode prompts fold the final adapted system text into `messages` without returning parallel `system` or `systemBlocks` fields.

Tool-name collisions now throw consistently across prompt-time tool sources, with both owners attributed. Skill, context, contributor, blackboard, and prompt-level tools must use unique names; call-site `generate()`/`stream()` tools remain the intentional override path.

`compilePrompt().inspect()` now runs with quiet observability, instrumentation, and diagnostics ports: it still executes the shared resolver pass and memo-cache path, but emits no spans, artifacts, diagnostics, or cache instrumentation events.

Harden prompt authoring types for the stable beta surface: `messages` mode is now compile-time exclusive with `system`/`prompt`, `when()` wrapper predicates receive partial context input, `match()` branch input keys are included as optional merged input fields, concrete prompts preserve literal `hasOutput`, and heterogeneous `AnyPromptConfig` remains assignable from precise prompt configs.

Consolidate custom prompt composition on `contributor()`: remove the public `injectable()` factory and related `InjectableConfig`/`InjectableEntry`/`PromptInjection` exports, rename `ContributorContribution` to `Contribution`, rename `AdapterMap` to `ProviderAdaptations`, and keep primitive-family attribution internal to first-party factories.

Add portable tool-loop controls to `GenerationSettings`: `toolChoice`, `stopWhen`, `maxSteps`, and the `maxSteps()` / `hasToolCall()` helpers. Core-step adapters honor neutral stop conditions, OpenAI/Anthropic/AI SDK adapters map neutral tool choice to provider-native request fields, and provider-specific tool-control variants move to each adapter's typed `extra` option.

Make provider prompt caching a stable-prefix contract: cached context blocks now compose before the uncached tail, token budgets can drop only uncached blocks, prompt-level static system text can join the provider cache prefix, `SystemBlock.cacheBoundary` marks the single native breakpoint, and `prompt.budget` artifacts report `prefixOverflow` when the stable prefix exceeds the requested budget.

Add freshness record metadata for resolved contexts: inspect parts and `context.contribution` artifacts now report live-vs-memo provenance, original resolution time, memo-hit age, and optional segment source facts (`observedAt` / `sourceVersion`) when primitives such as retrievers already provide them.

Tighten adapter parity and trust behavior: usage metadata no longer fabricates zero-token counts when providers omit usage, forged or mismatched tool approval responses become model-visible denial results instead of thrown errors, agent tool composition avoids prompt type widening, AI SDK call settings pass through to gateway calls, AI SDK structured streams report dropped tool observability through each request's diagnostics, and provider cache boundary conformance now runs across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and AI SDK adapters.

Add adapter contract harness scaffolding for the pre-launch API cleanup: target type assertions, a canonical result validator for shared conformance tests, canonical options fixtures, and headless equivalence TODO rows for the handle/transport phases.

Nest normalized generation usage details under `inputTokenDetails` and `outputTokenDetails`, preserving no-fabricated-zero usage semantics while exposing cache-read/cache-write/reasoning token classes consistently. Add the portable `GenerationSettings.reasoning` hint and map it across AI SDK, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google adapters.

Replace generation `timeoutMs` with structured `timeout` budgets: `totalMs` for the whole managed call, `stepMs` for provider attempts, `chunkMs` for stalled streams, and `toolMs`/`tools[name]` for tool execution. Crux timeouts now reject with typed `TimeoutError`, and loop-runtime step observers use `onStepEnd`.

Return canonical native adapter result envelopes from `generate()` and `stream()`: accumulated `text`, optional complete `usage`, optional `cost`, `steps`, `finalStep`, provider-neutral `messages`, typed `.raw`, and retained `_meta` for observability. Native streaming now returns `{ textStream, raw, completion }`, with `completion` resolving to the same canonical envelope fields.

Bring `@use-crux/ai` into the same adapter contract: portable AI SDK call settings now use canonical Crux fields, SDK-native request controls live under `extra`, `generate()` and `stream()` return canonical envelopes with typed `.raw`, and stateless UI-message helpers bridge canonical stream results to AI SDK `useChat` responses.

Move tool approval policy to composition layers: declare `toolApproval` on contexts, prompts, or call options; tool definitions no longer carry approval policy. Approval resolution now preserves exact-over-wildcard precedence, call-site/prompt/context provenance in inspect output, and the existing suspend/resume token hardening across native and AI SDK adapters.

Document the `@use-crux/core` stable beta contract in `packages/core/STABILITY.md`, add the `0.4.0-beta.0` changelog entry, and align prompt/context/adapter docs with the stabilized composition, caching, freshness, and tool-control surfaces.

Add typed per-tool execution context: tools can declare `contextSchema`, callers supply validated `toolsContext` keyed by tool name, and shared `runtimeContext` now threads through tool execution, middleware, and approval-policy callbacks across core and AI adapter calls.

Expose public adapter codecs and the first headless call handle: all adapters now export `toParams()`/`fromResponse()` translation helpers, and `@use-crux/anthropic` supports `prepare()`/`step()`/`finish()` over the same executor path as managed `generate()`.

Complete the headless ladder across first-party generation adapters: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and AI SDK expose `prepare()` handles, `generate()` accepts typed `transport` callbacks, managed/handle/transport equivalence is covered by adapter tests, and `stream()` with `transport` now fails explicitly with `CruxTransportStreamUnsupportedError`.

Raise all Crux workspace packages to a Node.js 22 ESM-only contract: package exports no longer include CommonJS `require` conditions, and local skill file loading moved from `@use-crux/core/skill` to the explicit Node-only `@use-crux/core/skill/node` subpath. Replace `import { skill } from '@use-crux/core/skill'` with `import { skill } from '@use-crux/core/skill/node'` anywhere you call `skill.fromFile()`.

Keep quality signal capture independent from a previously configured observability transport: evaluation cells still capture trace records synchronously, but a stale or hanging forwarding transport no longer stalls quality runs or inflates cell durations.
