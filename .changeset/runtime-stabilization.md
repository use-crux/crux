Declare `@use-crux/core/runtime` and its store-adapter contract experimental while Runtime Engine stabilization continues.

Remove unused Runtime Engine dead port exports, validate `crux.flows.signal()` against the durable flow snapshot before emitting, warn once when a durable target name is re-registered with a different definition, and make production `createRuntimeHandler()` fail closed unless wake request verification is configured explicitly or supplied by the wake adapter.

Embed delivered event payloads in runtime flow snapshots so flow replay no longer scans the event log after delivery. Store adapters must persist the `payload` field passed to `state.markSnapshotDelivered()`.

Add Runtime Engine retention config and bounded maintenance pruning for events, terminal work, terminal snapshots, confirmed outbox rows, idempotency keys, settled timers, and settled waiters. The memory, Postgres, and Convex runtime stores implement the new prune contract and conformance coverage.

Fence Runtime Engine wake commits with lease tokens and heartbeat leases while target code runs. Stale workers now exit cleanly with `LEASE_LOST` instead of retrying, dead-lettering, or overwriting a reclaimed worker's result.

Add named Runtime Engine composite commits and the optional store-adapter `runComposite(kind, input)` override. Core keeps the default `transact()` runner, and the Convex runtime component now routes composites through one mutation for atomic host-bound commits.

Make `config()` lifecycle-safe by installing one hook layer per active config, replacing the previous active config on repeat calls, and keeping independent layers such as imperative devtools intact when a config is disposed.

Hard-rename the global hook-store API from the runtime family to the hooks family: `CruxHooks`, `getHooks()`, `setHooks()`, `updateHooks()`, `resetHooks()`, and `mergeHooks()`. The old hook-store names are removed with no deprecated aliases so Runtime Engine terminology can stay unambiguous.

Rename the Runtime Engine task target factory from `task()` to `durableTask()` and remove the dead task output generic. Project Index runtime target discovery and lint guidance now recognize `durableTask()` declarations. Remove `createConvexRuntimeBridge` from the public `@use-crux/convex` root and package subpath; use `createCruxConvex().run()`, `.storage()`, and `.bridge()` as the single Convex entry point.

Add `createTestRuntime()` on `@use-crux/core/runtime/testing` for app-level Runtime Engine tests. The harness installs an in-memory runtime hook layer, provides a controllable clock for `flow.after()` and suspend timeouts, and exposes bounded `tick()`/`settle()` helpers without real timers.
