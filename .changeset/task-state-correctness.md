Stabilize Plan & Tasks task-list state handling: duplicate IDs, removed tasks, discarded lists, terminal transitions, pending/cancelled status derivation, and stale counter repair now resolve through typed lifecycle errors and row-derived state.

Cut over the experimental Plans & Tasks API to the canonical `plan()`, `tasks()`, and `task()` surface. Plan and task handles are command handles with `get()`/`list()` reads, existing entities are bound with `plan.ref()` and `tasks.ref()`, creation tools live at `plan.tool()` and `tasks.tool()` with safe `created()` accessors, and the old `tasklist`, top-level agent/tool factories, and first-match task-list lookup exports are removed from public entrypoints.

Add typed task definitions for `tasks({ items })`: keyed `task()` specs now infer literal task IDs for reads, lifecycle methods, and workers, infer schema-backed `complete()` result payloads, validate completed results at runtime, and reject non-JSON plan/task metadata and task results before persistence.
