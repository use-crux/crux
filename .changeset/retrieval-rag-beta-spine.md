Introduce the Retrieval & RAG stable beta public API spine at `@use-crux/core/retrieval`, including `knowledgeBase`, named `retrievalRecipe`, typed retrieval steps, canonical `RetrieveRequest`, schema-derived metadata filters, recipe traces, and grounding/tool integration types. The old anonymous retrieval pipeline/stage and per-retriever reranker public exports are no longer part of the beta surface.

Wire `knowledgeBase` lifecycle methods to the existing indexing, corpus, indexed-knowledge, storage, and retriever primitives. Knowledge bases can now index, reindex, remove sources, create namespace-scoped handles, retrieve through store-backed indexes, and inspect lifecycle/storage capability metadata.

Implement the named single-retriever `retrievalRecipe` runtime. Recipes now execute typed steps, expose `.retrieveWithTrace()` and `.asRetriever()`, capture failed-step traces, run fanout with bounded concurrency, keep score history in structured hit provenance, support recipe-level and per-step models, emit recipe/step observability spans, and replace the old internal pipeline/stage modules.
